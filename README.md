## 📑 Introduction Scale3DUR

3D-MoRe is a novel framework designed to generate large-scale 3D-language datasets by leveraging foundational models. It integrates multi-modal embedding, cross-modal interaction, and a language model decoder to process natural language instructions and 3D scene data, enhancing reasoning capabilities in complex 3D environments.
